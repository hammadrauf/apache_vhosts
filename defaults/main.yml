# Available templates:
#
# Currentl there are the following templates available:
#
# - redirect_to_ssl: redirects all the requests to https.
#
# - standard: configures a virtual host with the following sections (in order):
#   includes, rewrite rules, proxy pass, headers, balancer and log settings.
#
# Example:
#
# apache_vhosts:
#   - server_name: example.domain.local
